In this contribution we present ongoing work towards extending the NNPDF4.0 NNLO determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) with QED effects and a photon PDF. We study the impact of QED effects in the NNPDF4.0 fit, compare our results with NNPDF3.1QED and other recent QED PDF fits, and we assess the impact of the photon PDF for representative LHC processes.}
